// A new worker is constructed, and hello is passed in as its data.
// The code running in the worker accesses its data and passes a new friendly message back to the main thread.
// The main threadâ€™s event listener picks up the message sent from the worker thread and emits it to the console.
// The worker thread has no more code to run, so it exits. The main thread is notified of this by the exit event.
